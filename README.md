# ava-class

This is a test for doing AVA classification based on an unsupervised learning algorithm. I'm trying to figure out if <a href="http://torch.ch">Torch7</a> is going to work easily for my target grading robot, or if I should stick to <a href="http://tensorflow.com">TensorFlow</a>.

This work is based on the awesome ideas of Ben Bougher and Felix Herrmann in their 2016 SEG Expanded Abstract <a href="http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/segam2016-13874419.1">AVA Classification as an Unsupervised Machine-Learning Problem</a>.
