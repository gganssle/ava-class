# Data loading

I'm testing loading seismic data into Torch here. Since my data started out in the format of <a href="https://github.com/SeismicJulia/Seismic.jl">Seismic.jl</a> I have the data samples already stripped and ready for import. The Julia script here is just to remind me of the extents/etc of the data.
